 <p class="info">About The Book :- <br>
    Every physicist agrees quantum mechanics is
     among humanity's finest scientific achievements. But ask what it means,
     and the result will be a brawl. For a century, most physicists have followed
     Niels Bohr's solipsistic and poorly reasoned Copenhagen interpretation.
     Indeed, questioning it has long meant professional ruin, yet some daring physicists,
     such as John Bell, David Bohm, and Hugh Everett, persisted in seeking the true meaning
     of quantum mechanics. What Is Real? is the gripping story of this battle of ideas and the 
     courageous scientists who dared to stand up for truth. <br>

     4.Through Two Doors at Once: The Elegant Experiment That Captures the Enigma of Our Quantum Reality</h1>

<p class="info">About The Book :- <br>

    Many of science's greatest minds have grappled with the simple yet elusive "double-slit" experiment. Thomas Young devised it in the early 1800s to show that light behaves like a wave,
     and in doing so opposed Isaac Newton. Nearly a century later, Albert Einstein showed that 
     light comes in quanta, or particles, and the experiment became key to a fierce debate between 
     Einstein and Niels Bohr over the nature of reality. Richard Feynman held that the double slit
      embodies the central mystery of the quantum world. Decade after decade, hypothesis after hypothesis,
       scientists have returned to this ingenious experiment to help them answer deeper and deeper questions
        about the fabric of the universe.

    How can a single particle behave both like a particle and a wave? Does a particle exist before we look
     at it, or does the very act of looking create reality? Are there hidden aspects to reality missing from
      the orthodox view of quantum physics? Is there a place where the quantum world ends and the familiar
       classical world of our daily lives begins, and if so, can we find it? And if there's no such place, 
       then does the universe split into two each time a particle goes through the double slit?
    
    With his extraordinarily gifted eloquence, Anil Ananthaswamy travels around the world and through 
    history, down to the smallest scales of physical reality we have yet fathomed. Through Two Doors at 
    Once is the most fantastic voyage you can take. <br> </p>

     <p class="info">About The Book :-  <br>
        The latest investigation from acclaimed nuclear engineer and author James Mahaffey unearths forgotten nuclear endeavors throughout history that were sometimes hair-brained, often risky, and always fascinating.

        Whether you are a scientist or a poet, pro-nuclear energy or staunch opponent, conspiracy theorist or pragmatist, James Mahaffey's books have served to open up the world of nuclear science like never before. With clear explanations of some of the most complex scientific endeavors in history, Mahaffey's new book looks back at the atom's wild, secretive past and then toward its potentially bright future.
        
        Mahaffey unearths lost reactors on far flung Pacific islands and trees that were exposed to
         active fission that changed gender or bloomed in the dead of winter. He explains why we have
        nuclear submarines but not nuclear aircraft and why cold fusion doesn't exist. And who knew 
        that radiation counting was once a fashionable trend? Though parts of the nuclear history might
        seem like a fiction mash-up, where cowboys somehow got a hold of a reactor, Mahaffey's
        vivid prose holds the reader in thrall of the infections energy of scientific curiosity and ingenuity 
        that may one day hold the key to solving our energy crisis or sending us to Mars.

      6.Beyond Weird: Why Everything You Thought You Knew about Quantum Physics Is Different </h1>
  <img class="icon" src="icons/61q1V5yXRNL.jpg" alt="Diamonds-icon">

 <p class="info">About The Book :- <br>
    
    Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.
     Since Niels Bohr said this many years ago, quantum mechanics has only been getting more shocking.
      We now realize that it's not really telling us that weird things happen out of sight, on the tiniest
    level, in the atomic world: rather, everything is quantum. But if quantum mechanics is correct,
     what seems obvious and right in our everyday world is built on foundations that don't seem obvious
     or right at all--or even possible. An exhilarating tour of the contemporary quantum landscape,
     Beyond Weird is a book about what quantum physics really means--and what it doesn't. Science
     writer Philip Ball offers an up-to-date, accessible account of the quest to come to grips with
     the most fundamental theory of physical reality,
     and to explain how its counterintuitive principles underpin the world we experience.

          <p class="info">About The Book :-  <br>
      
            When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Is the apparent 'grand design'
             of our universe evidence for a benevolent creator who set things in motion?
              Or does science offer another explanation?

        In The Grand Design, the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries 
        of the universe is presented in language marked by both brilliance and simplicity.
         Model dependent realism, the multiverse, the top-down theory of cosmology,
         and the unified M-theory - all are revealed here.

        This is the first major work in nearly a decade by one of the world's greatest thinkers.
         A succinct, startling and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our
          understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design
           is a book that will inform - and provoke - like no other.

 <p class="info">About The Book :- <br>
      At the beginning of the 21st century, physics is being driven to very unfamiliar territory--the domain of the incredibly small and the incredibly heavy.
    The new world is a world in which both quantum mechanics and gravity are equally important.
     But mysteries remain. One of the biggest involved black holes. Famed physicist Stephen Hawking 
    claimed that anything sucked in a black hole was lost forever. For three decades,
    Leonard Susskind and Hawking clashed over the answer to this problem. Finally, in 2004,
       Hawking conceded.

    THE BLACK HOLE WAR will explain the mind-blowing science that finally won out, 
    and the emergence of a new paradigm that argues the world--this catalog, your home,
   your breakfast, you--is actually a hologram projected from the edges of space.

  What are time and space made of? Where does matter come from?
  And what exactly is reality? Scientist Carlo Rovelli has spent his life exploring these questions
 and pushing the boundaries of what we know. Here he explains how our image of the world has changed 
 throughout centuries. From Aristotle to Albert Einstein, Michael Faraday to the Higgs boson, he takes
 us on a wondrous journey to show us that beyond our ever-changing idea of reality
  is a whole new world that has yet to be discovered.Reality Is Not What It Seems:
   The Journey to Quantum Gravity is an illustrated book by Italian physicist Carlo Rovelli. 
   The book discusses quantum gravity. It was first published in Italian in 2014.
    It was published in English in 2016 by which time the English
   translation of Seven Brief Lessons had already appeared

  <img class="icon" src="icons/order of time.jpg" alt="Diamonds-icon">
     <p class="info">About The Book :-  <br>
        'We are time. We are this space, this clearing opened by the traces of memory inside the 
        connections between our neurons. We are memory. We are nostalgia. We are longing for a future that will not come'

        Time is a mystery that does not cease to puzzle us. Philosophers, artists and poets have long explored its meaning while scientists have found that its structure is different from the simple intuition we have of it.
         From Boltzmann to quantum theory, from Einstein to loop quantum gravity, our understanding 
         of time has been undergoing radical transformations. Time flows at a different speed in different 
         places, the past and the future differ far less than we might think, and the very notion of the 
         present evaporates in the vast universe.
        
        With his extraordinary charm and sense of wonder,
         bringing together science, philosophy and art, Carlo Rovelli unravels this mystery.
          Enlightening and consoling, The Order of Time shows that to understand ourselves we need to reflect
           on time -- and to understand time we need to reflect on ourselves.
